## file1.py

This file contains a Python module with a single function called `greet()`. The purpose of this function is to print a personalized greeting message to the user.

### greet(name)

This function takes a single argument, `name`, which is the name of the user. It returns a greeting message that is formatted with the user's name.

Here is an example of how to use the `greet()` function:
```python
greet("John Doe")
# Output: Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the project.
```
If you run the `file1.py` script directly, it will prompt the user to enter their name and then print a greeting message using the `greet()` function.

```bash
$ python file1.py
Enter your name: John Doe
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the project.
```
